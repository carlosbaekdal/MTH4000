Programming in Python has been very eye opening. From not doing any computer science at GCSE or A-level, this hasn't been easy but it's key to ask questions, turn up to lectures and lab sessions and just try your best. So far we have done all kinds of stuff like: loops, defining functions, sketching graphs and literally so much more, if i keep writing then we would be here for too long and I don't want to waste any more of your precious time.
